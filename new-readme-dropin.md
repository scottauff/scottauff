# 👋 Hey, I’m Scott

> Freedom tech, privacy, and AI automation for families & small businesses.

I’m a software engineer and founder of **TechHammer**, focused on helping normal people and local businesses break free from Big Tech and take control of their digital lives.

- 🛠️ Building privacy-first, self-hosted stacks for families & small businesses  
- ⚡ Exploring Bitcoin, energy, and thermodynamics as hard constraints in economics  
- 🤖 Designing practical AI workflows (not hype) for real-world work  
- 🌐 Based in Upstate South Carolina, working with people remotely

- **The Forge** – a community for families & small biz owners who want local-first, open-source tools  
- A personal knowledge base + SOP library for repeatable tech setups and client work

## 🧰 Languages & Tools

These are the tools I reach for most often:

- **Languages** – TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Bash  
- **Backend** – Node.js, Express, REST APIs
